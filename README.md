# reinforcement-herding
Learning the herding task using reinforcement learning

## Project description

The idea is to use reinforcement learning to implement an agent that is capable of doing the herding task. The end goal is that the behaviour of the shepherd is not scripted, but learned; since learning takes time, refactoring of the FRIsheeping source code is a must.

## Rough plan ahead

### 1st deadline
- take a look into related works
- get familiar with the FRIsheeping source code
- concretely define the goals of the project

### 2nd deadline
- adjust goals according to feedback received from first report
- 1st version of the reinforcement learning algorihtm

### 3rd deadline
- adjust goals according to feedback received from second report
- polishing the reinforcement learning algorithm
- video creation
